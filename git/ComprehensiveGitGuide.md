# Part 1: Basic Git Commands

## Version Control
- Introduction to the concept of version control.
- Advantages of using version control in projects.
- Overview of version history management.

## Git Basics
### Creating a Repository
- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
- Creating a `.gitignore` file to specify untracked files.

### Staging and Committing
- `git status`: Check the status of files.
- `git add [file]`: Add files to the staging area.
- `git commit -m "[message]"`: Commit changes with a message.

### Branching and Merging
- `git branch [branch-name]`: Create a new branch.
- `git checkout [branch-name]`: Switch to a different branch.
- `git merge [branch-name]`: Merge a branch into the current branch.

### Examining History
- `git log`: View commit history.

## GitHub Integration
### Setting Up GitHub
- Tutorial on creating a GitHub account and setting up SSH keys.

### Cloning and Remote Repositories
- `git clone [repository-url]`: Clone a remote repository.
- `git remote add origin [repository-url]`: Connect your local repository to a remote repository.

### Push and Pull
- `git pull origin [branch-name]`: Update local repository with changes from the remote repository.
- `git push origin [branch-name]`: Push local changes to the remote repository.

## Workflow
- A walkthrough of the typical Git and GitHub workflow, from initialization to pushing changes to a remote repository.

# Advanced Git Commands

## Viewing Changes
- `git diff`: Shows the differences between files in the working directory and the staging area.
- `git diff --staged`: Compares staged changes to the last commit.

## Undoing Changes
- `git checkout -- [file]`: Discards changes in the working directory for a specific file.
- `git reset [file]`: Unstages a file while preserving the changes in the working directory.
- `git reset --hard [commit]`: Resets the current branch to a specific commit and discards all changes since that commit.

## Working with Remote Repositories
- `git fetch [remote]`: Downloads all changes from the remote repository, but doesn't merge them into your own code.
- `git pull`: Combines `git fetch` and `git merge`, updating your current branch with the latest changes from the remote.
- `git push [remote] [branch]`: Sends your commits to the remote repository.

## Branching and Merging
- `git branch`: Lists all branches in your repository.
- `git branch -d [branch-name]`: Deletes a branch safely.
- `git branch -D [branch-name]`: Force deletes a branch, losing changes on that branch.
- `git merge [branch]`: Merges the specified branch into the current branch.

## Stashing
- `git stash`: Temporarily stores all modified tracked files.
- `git stash pop`: Applies stashed changes and removes them from the stash.
- `git stash apply`: Applies stashed changes without removing them from the stash.

## Tagging
- `git tag [tag-name]`: Marks a specific point in the repositoryâ€™s history as important, typically used for releases.

## Git Log
- `git log --oneline`: A condensed view of the commit history.
- `git log --graph`: Displays the branch and merge history in an ASCII graph.

## .gitignore
- `.gitignore`: A text file where you can specify files and directories to be ignored by Git.

# Extended Git Features

## Submodules
- **Purpose:** Allow a Git repository to contain, as a subdirectory, a checkout of an external project.
- **Usage:** 
  - `git submodule add [URL] [directory]`: Adds a new submodule.
  - `git submodule init`: Initializes a submodule.
  - `git submodule update`: Updates the submodule to the commit specified by the superproject.
- **Benefits:** Useful for including libraries or other external projects within your repository.

## Sub-trees
- **Purpose:** Alternative to submodules, used to manage dependencies.
- **Usage:** 
  - `git subtree add --prefix [directory] [repository] [branch]`: Adds a subtree.
  - `git subtree pull --prefix [directory] [repository] [branch]`: Updates the subtree with the latest changes.
- **Benefits:** Easier to use and more flexible than submodules, especially for contributors who don't need to know about the existence of the subtree.

## Hooks
- **Purpose:** Scripts that run automatically on specific important actions in the Git workflow, like commit, push, and receive.
- **Usage:** 
  - Located in the `.git/hooks` directory.
  - Rename a sample hook file (e.g., `pre-commit.sample` to `pre-commit`) and customize it.
- **Benefits:** Allows for automation of certain tasks like code testing, style check, or build processes.

## Rebasing
- **Purpose:** Reapply commits on top of another base tip.
- **Usage:** 
  - `git rebase [base]`: Reapplies commits on top of the specified base.
  - `git rebase -i [base]`: Interactive rebasing allows you to modify commits as they are moved to the new base.
- **Benefits:** Cleaner, linear history. Useful for cleaning up commit history before merging a feature branch into the main branch.

## Advanced Merge Strategies
- **Purpose:** Resolve complex merge conflicts and combine code from different branches.
- **Usage:**
  - `git merge --no-ff`: Creates a merge commit even if a fast-forward merge is possible.
  - `git merge --squash`: Combines all changes into a single commit.
- **Benefits:** Allows for more control over the merge process and commit history.

## Clone a Specific Subdirectory from a Repository
- **Purpose:** Clone only a specific subdirectory from a repository.
- **Usage:** 
  - `git clone --depth 1 --branch INSERT_BRANCH_NAME --no-checkout INSERT_REPO_REMOTE_URL`: Clone the repository without checking out the files.
  - `cd INSERT_ROOT_FOLDER/`: Change directory to the root folder of the repository.
  - `git sparse-checkout set INSERT_SUBDIRECTORY_RELATIVE-PAT`: Set the subdirectory to be checked out.
  - `git checkout`: Check out the subdirectory.
- **Benefits:** Useful for large repositories where you only need a specific subdirectory.

# Conclusion
